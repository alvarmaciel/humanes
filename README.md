# CRUD of Socies of Humano Mutual

## Project Requirements:

1. Build a CRUD API using Python and FastAPI framework.
2. Use GraphQL as the query language and Strawberry as the GraphQL library.
3. The API must be asynchronous.
4. Use Behavior Driven Development to develop the API and Strict Test Driven Development with tests written before implementation.
5. The API must be well-documented with Swagger UI.
6. The API should support authentication and authorization with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Project Constraints:

1. We'll use Python as the language for the API development.
2. FastAPI will be used as the web framework.
3. GraphQL will be used as the query language and Strawberry as the GraphQL library.
4. The API must be asynchronous.
5. Behavior Driven Development will be used with a library of your choice.
6. Strict Test Driven Development will be used with tests written before implementation.

## Project Deliverables:
1. Install required dependencies like Python, FastAPI, and Strawberry.
2. Define the API schema using GraphQL.
3.  Write test cases for the implemented functions using the test library of your choice.
4. Write the scenarios.
5. Implement the schema with the appropriate query and mutation functions.
6. Write the implementation code to pass the test cases.
7. Ensure the API is asynchronous by using async/await functions.
8. Add Swagger UI for API documentation.
9. Implement authentication and authorization with JWT.

For the BDD part, we can use the Behave library, which is a popular Python BDD framework. It integrates well with the
FastAPI framework, and we can write Gherkin syntax feature files that describe the behavior of the API.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. We can proceed with the above steps and create a great API for your
project.
